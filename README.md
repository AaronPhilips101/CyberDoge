## Read the docs

Here are the most useful "global" variables that can be used on any module you create:

- ENV: A global object which allows access to enviroment variables defined in env.py
- client: A modified version of the telegram client.
- client.storage: A global storage object for the current session.
- events: A simple function that returns a events.NewMessage object.
- progress: Generic progress callback for both uploads and downloads.
- time_formatter: Input time in milliseconds, to get beautified time, as string.
- humanbytes: Input size in bytes, outputs in a human readable format.
- You can learn alot just by reading the telethon [documentory](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/latest/)
- Here is a simple module that adds " world" to the message if you send ".hello".

```
@client.on(events("hello"))
async def handler(event):
	await event.edit(event.text[1:] + " world.")
```

- Enjoy creating your own modules :P
